# Assignment 2.6 – Diode Selection for a Real Application

### Application

This project involves designing a basic 12 V DC input protection circuit to safeguard electronic parts against accidental reverse polarity connections.

### Selected Diode

**1N5819 Schottky Diode**

### Justification

#### Voltage Rating

With a maximum reverse voltage capacity of 40 V, the 1N5819 easily handles the 12 V DC requirement while leaving plenty of headroom for potential voltage spikes.

#### Current Rating

This component can handle an average forward current of up to 1 A, making it an excellent fit for low to medium-power electronics.

#### Cost and Availability

As a highly affordable and easy-to-find component, the 1N5819 is a standard industry choice for power protection implementations, ensuring a practical real-world design.

### Simulation

Testing in LTspice verifies that the circuit works as intended. The diode successfully permits current to pass when connected properly and entirely blocks it during a reverse connection, ensuring the load remains secure.
