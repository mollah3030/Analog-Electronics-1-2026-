## Reflection
In this assignment, I understood the core ideas of semiconductors and how electrons and holes influence conductivity.  
The hardest part for me was using the diode equations correctly and keeping all the units consistent.  
Overall, this work helped me link the theory with the numerical calculations in a clearer way.
