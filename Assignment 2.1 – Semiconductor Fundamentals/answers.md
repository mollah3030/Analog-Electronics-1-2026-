# Written Answers (Questions 1–3)

## Question 1  
**Describe the difference between n-type and p-type semiconductor materials.**

**Answer:**  
n-type and p-type semiconductors are different mainly because of the dopant used and which charge carrier becomes dominant.

In an **n-type** semiconductor, pure silicon (or germanium) is doped with a **pentavalent** element like phosphorus or arsenic. Since the dopant has **five valence electrons**, one electron is not needed for bonding and becomes a **free electron**. Therefore, **electrons are the majority carriers**, and **holes are the minority carriers**.

In a **p-type** semiconductor, the material is doped with a **trivalent** element such as boron or aluminum. These atoms have **three valence electrons**, so one bond is missing an electron, which creates a **hole**. As a result, **holes become the majority carriers**, while **electrons become the minority carriers**.

## Question 2  
**Describe the conditions established by forward- and reverse-bias conditions on a p–n junction diode and how the resulting current is affected.**

**Answer:**  
In **forward bias**, the **p-side is connected to the positive terminal** and the **n-side to the negative terminal**. This connection **reduces the depletion region** and **lowers the barrier potential**, so carriers can move across the junction more easily. Once the barrier is low enough, the diode conducts and the **current increases strongly**.

In **reverse bias**, the **p-side is connected to the negative terminal** and the **n-side to the positive terminal**. This makes the depletion region **wider** and increases the barrier potential, which prevents normal carrier flow. Because of this, the current is **almost zero**, except for a **tiny leakage current** caused by minority carriers.

## Question 3  
**Describe in your own words the meaning of the word ideal as applied to a device or a system.**

**Answer:**  
In electronics, **ideal** means a device or system behaves in a perfect theoretical way with **no real-world imperfections**. It assumes there are **no losses** and no limitations such as resistance, heating, leakage, or temperature effects. The device follows the basic theory exactly, which helps simplify calculations and understand concepts.

For example, an **ideal diode** would have **zero voltage drop** when forward biased and would **block all current completely** when reverse biased. Even though ideal devices do not exist in practice, they are very useful for learning and basic circuit analysis.
